# Helper Functionality Package

## Introduction

The helper_functionality package provides text processing utilities for handling and normalizing markdown and LaTeX content. It focuses on code fence validation and repair, as well as LaTeX math delimiter fixing for reliable rendering in chat applications and documentation systems.

## Core Components

- **code_fences.py**: Markdown code fence validation, repair, and language detection utilities
- **latex.py**: LaTeX math delimiter fixing and normalization tools

## Features

### Code Fence Management
- Validates markdown code fences (``` and ~~~) for proper opening and closing
- Automatically repairs unclosed or mismatched code blocks
- Heuristic programming language detection based on code content
- Normalizes fence lengths to prevent conflicts with code content
- Handles section boundaries and prevents fence issues across markdown headers

### LaTeX Math Processing
- Repairs unbalanced or mismatched math delimiters ($, $$, \(, \), \[, \])
- Protects code blocks, comments, and verbatim environments from modification
- Distinguishes between math expressions and currency notation
- Converts align environments to aligned for better markdown compatibility
- Provides detailed edit logs for all changes made

## Technical Architecture

The package implements two main processing pipelines:

**Code Fence Pipeline**: Uses regular expressions to identify fence patterns, validates nesting and closure, and applies repairs while preserving content integrity. Language detection uses pattern matching for common syntax features.

**LaTeX Pipeline**: Employs a tokenizer-based approach to track math delimiter state, respects escape sequences and protected regions, and maintains a stack-based system for proper nesting validation.

Both components return detailed change logs for transparency and debugging.

## Usage

### Code Fence Validation and Repair

```python
from chat_server_demo.helper_functionality.code_fences import (
    validate_code_fences, fix_code_fences, ensure_fenced_code, guess_lang
)

# Validate existing code fences
text = "```python\nprint('hello')\n"  # missing closing fence
is_valid, issues = validate_code_fences(text)
# Returns: (False, ["Unclosed code fence started on line 1"])

# Fix code fence issues
fixed_text, changes = fix_code_fences(text)
# Returns normalized text with proper closing fence

# Complete validation and repair workflow
final_text, all_changes = ensure_fenced_code(text, default_lang="python")

# Language detection
code = "def hello():\n    print('world')"
language = guess_lang(code)  # Returns "python"
```

### LaTeX Math Delimiter Repair

```python
from chat_server_demo.helper_functionality.latex import (
    LaTeXFixer, fix_latex_delimiters, fix_align_environments
)

# Basic delimiter fixing
text = "This is inline math $x = 2 and display math $$y = 3"  # unbalanced
fixer = LaTeXFixer(close_on_newline=True)
fixed_text, edits = fixer.fix(text)

# Convenience function for complete LaTeX repair
text_with_align = "\\begin{align}x &= 1\\\\y &= 2\\end{align}"
repaired, changes = fix_latex_delimiters(text_with_align)
# Converts to $$\begin{aligned}...\end{aligned}$$

# Align environment normalization only
aligned_text = fix_align_environments(text_with_align)
```

### Working with Edit Records

```python
# Edit records provide detailed change information
fixed_text, edits = fixer.fix(problematic_text)

for edit in edits:
    print(f"{edit.kind}: {edit.reason}")
    if edit.kind == "replace":
        print(f"  Changed '{edit.before}' to '{edit.after}' at position {edit.pos}")
    elif edit.kind == "insert":
        print(f"  Inserted '{edit.after}' at position {edit.pos}")
```

### Language Detection Examples

```python
# Supports multiple languages
guess_lang("SELECT * FROM users")  # Returns "sql"
guess_lang("function test() { console.log('hi'); }")  # Returns "javascript"
guess_lang("#!/bin/bash\necho 'hello'")  # Returns "bash"
guess_lang('{"name": "value"}')  # Returns "json"
guess_lang("key: value\nother: data")  # Returns "yaml"
```
